## PDF Invoice Generation

### Setup

The application includes an automated PDF invoice generation system. To configure it:

1. **Development Mode (Demo)**: 
   - No configuration needed
   - Uses mock PDF generation for testing
   - Generates demo PDFs with invoice data

2. **Production Mode**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the environment example
   cp .env.example .env.local
   
   # Configure your PDF generation API
   NEXT_PUBLIC_INVOICE_API_URL=http://localhost:11111
   ```

### API Integration

The system expects a PDF generation API with the following endpoints:

#### Generate Invoice PDF
```
POST http://localhost:11111/invoices
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "client": {
    "name": "Client Company Name",
    "address": "123 Client Street\nCity, Country\nPostal Code",
    "companyId": "ABC123",
    "vatNumber": "GB123456789",
    "email": "contact@client.com",
    "phone": "+44 123 456 7890"
  },
  "products": [
    {
      "name": "Product 1",
      "sku": "PRD001",
      "price": 100.00,
      "quantity": 2
    }
  ],
  "invoice_id": "INV-2024-001",
  "payment_method": "WIRE",
  "currency": "GBP",
  "vat_rate": 20.0,
  "countryCode": "GB"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "invoice_id": "FIBEM-FR-20251004-161806-821644",
  "message": "Professional invoice generated successfully!",
  "url": "http://localhost:11111/static/invoice-FIBEM-FR-20251004-161806-821644.pdf"
}
```

#### Retrieve Invoice PDF
```
GET http://localhost:11111/invoices/{invoice_id}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "invoice_id": "FIBEM-FR-20251004-161806-821644",
  "message": "Professional invoice generated successfully!",
  "url": "http://localhost:11111/static/invoice-FIBEM-FR-20251004-161806-821644.pdf"
}
```

### How It Works

1. **Create Sale**: User fills out the sales form with customer and product details
2. **Country Selection**: System automatically sets currency and VAT rate based on selected country
3. **Generate Invoice**: On form submission, the system calls your PDF generation API with country code
4. **Store PDF URL**: The returned PDF URL is stored with the sale record
5. **View Invoice**: Users can view, download, or share the generated PDF invoice

### Country Code Features

- **Automatic Currency Selection**: EUR, USD, GBP, CHF, CAD, MAD, etc.
- **Dynamic VAT Rates**: Country-specific VAT rates (France: 20%, Germany: 19%, etc.)
- **Multi-Country Support**: 13+ countries including EU, North America, and North Africa
- **Localized Formatting**: Currency symbols and formatting based on country selection

### Demo Mode

When no API is configured, the system automatically uses demo mode:
- Simulates API delays and occasional failures
- Generates mock PDFs for testing
- Perfect for development and demonstration
